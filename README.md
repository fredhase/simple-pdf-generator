# simple-pdf-generator
A simple pdf generator about a project budget, using Jupyter. Made along the "Python Week #2" by Empowerdata

This project requires the user to install fpdf at least once.

This can be done by adding "!pip install fpdf" in a single cell, separated from the project's main cell.
